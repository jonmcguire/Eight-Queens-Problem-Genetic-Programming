# Eight-Queens-Problem-Genetic-Programming
''' Code by Jon McGuire Description  The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing:     eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard      so that no two queens threaten each other      thus, a solution requires that  no two queens share:     same row,     column,     or diagonal.    Challenge  The challenge is to generate one right sequence through Genetic Programming.  The sequence has to be 8 numbers between 0 to 7. Each number represents the positions the Queens can be placed.  Each number refers to the row number in the specific column  0 3 4 5 6 1 2 4  0 is the row number in the column 0 where the Queen can be placed  3 is the row number in the column 1 where the Queen can be placed   Sample Codebase The following is a sample code base for solving text generation using Genetic Computing  https://github.com/datasigntist/deeplearning/blob/master/Introduction_to_Genetic_Computing_2.ipynb  '''
